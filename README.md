# ðŸš— Streamlit Mini Quiz â€“ Auto Finance Advisor

A simple interactive quiz built with Streamlit to help users better understand auto financing, along with a call-to-action form to connect with an advisor.
This can serve as a channel for auto finance companies to engage with potential customers and build stronger interaction.

It uses a simple scoring logic, which can of course be modified to provide more accurate or insightful results.

This project is part of my learning journey with Python.
Your support and insights mean a lot to me.
